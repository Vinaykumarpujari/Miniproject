        <h2>Enrollment of NSS</h2>
        <hr/>
        <ul>
            <li>NSS is a voluntary scheme. NSS scheme starts from 11th Standard onwards. At college level the NSS volunteers will be enrolled from the first and second year degree-class students. The students from foreign countries studying in Indian universities can also join NSS so that they may share the experiences of national reconstruction and community work. NCC cadets will not be allowed to join NSS. Similarly NSS volunteers will not participate in NCC or any other youth organisation as long as they are in NSS.</li>

            <li>An NSS volunteer needs to devote a total of 240 hours social service in two years duration. Every year, a NSS volunteer has to devote 20 hrs. of orientation and 100 hrs. of community service.</li>

            <li>To enrol as NSS volunteer, contact the NSS Programme Officer of your school / college. Enrollment in NSS is free.</li>

            <li>The NSS volunteers on successful completion of the required hours of service are issued a certificate. NSS volunteers can get some weightage during admissions in higher studies and other benefits as decided by the institutions/university.</li>
        </ul>
